    $ gem install colissimo_label

require 'colissimo_label'
```

## Options

```ruby
ColissimoLabel.contract_number = ENV['COLISSIMO_CONTRACT_NUMBER']
```

Colissimo password (dedicated for webservices) (**required**):

I you want to save generated files on AWS S3, initialize the bucket:

Define the directory to save files (**required** if s3_bucket used):

```ruby
ColissimoLabel.s3_path = 'path/to/colissimo'
```

Declare local path to save generated files (**required** if no use of S3):

ColissimoLabel.colissimo_local_path = Rails.root.join('public', 'colissimo')
```

## Usage

### Fetch relay points

Colissimo webservices provides all relay points around an address.

To get all available relay :

```ruby
 relay_points = ColissimoLabel::FindRelayPoint.new(
         {
           address:      'Address',
           city:         'City',
           postcode:     'Postcode',
           country_code: 'Normalized country code (ex: FR)'
         },
         (Date.today + 5.days).strftime('%d/%m/%Y'), # Estimated departure date of the package
         1000 # Computed weight of the package (in grams)
       ).perform
```

It will return an array of relay points with the following data:

```
{
        :pickup_id,
        :name,
        :address,
        :postcode,
        :city,
        :country,
        :country_code,
        :latitude,
        :longitude,
        :distance,
        :max_weight,
        :parking,
        business_hours: {
          :monday,
          :tuesday,
          :wednesday,
          :thursday,
          :friday,
          :saturday,
          :sunday
        }

        9.99, # Amount of the shipping fees (paid by the customer)
        {
          company_name: 'Sender company name',
          address:      'Address',
          city:         'City',
          postcode:     'Postcode',
          country_code: 'Normalized country code (ex: DE)'
        },
        {
          last_name:    'Last name of the addressee',
          first_name:   'First name of the addressee',
          address_bis:  'Address bis of the addressee',
          address:      'Address of the addressee',
          city:         'City of the addressee',
          postcode:     'Postcode of the addressee',
          country_code: 'Normalized country code of the addressee',
          phone:        'Phone number of the addressee',
          mobile:       'Mobile number of the addressee',
          email:        'Email of the addressee'
        },
        customs_total_weight: 2, # Total weight of the package
        customs_data: [ # Details content of your package
          {
            description:   'Product description',
            quantity:      1,
            weight:        2,
            item_price:    100,
            country_code:  'FR',
            currency_code: 'EUR',
            customs_code:  'hsCode' # Harmonized system code of your product
          }
        ]
      ).perform
```

In both cases, if the label cannot be generated it raises a StandardError with the reason. Otherwise, the parcel number is returned and files saved in the specified folders.
