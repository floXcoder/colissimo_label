## Usage

To generate a new Colissimo label, use the following methods.

For a national address:

        'label_filename', # Name of the file generated
        'FR', # Normalized country code of the destination
        9.99, # Amount of the shipping fees (paid by the customer)
        {
          company_name: 'Sender company name',
          address:      'Address',
          city:         'City',
          postcode:     'Postcode',
          country_code: 'Normalized country code'
        },
        {
          last_name:    'Last name of the addressee',
          first_name:   'First name of the addressee',
          address_bis:  'Address bis of the addressee',
          address:      'Address of the addressee',
          city:         'City of the addressee',
          postcode:     'Postcode of the addressee',
          country_code: 'Normalized country code of the addressee',
          phone:        'Phone number of the addressee',
          mobile:       'Mobile number of the addressee',
          email:        'Email of the addressee'
        }
      ).perform
```

For a foreign address (which required customs declaration):

```ruby
parcel_number = ColissimoLabel::GenerateLabel.new(
        'label_filename', # Name of the file generated
        'CH', # Normalized country code of the destination
        9.99, # Amount of the shipping fees (paid by the customer)
        {
          company_name: 'Sender company name',
          address:      'Address',
          city:         'City',
          postcode:     'Postcode',
          country_code: 'Normalized country code'
        },
        {
          last_name:    'Last name of the addressee',
          first_name:   'First name of the addressee',
          address_bis:  'Address bis of the addressee',
          address:      'Address of the addressee',
          city:         'City of the addressee',
          postcode:     'Postcode of the addressee',
          country_code: 'Normalized country code of the addressee',
          phone:        'Phone number of the addressee',
          mobile:       'Mobile number of the addressee',
          email:        'Email of the addressee'
        },
        2, # Total weight of the package
        [ # Details content of your package
          {
            description:   'Product description',
            quantity:      1,
            weight:        2,
            item_price:    100,
            country_code:  'FR',
            currency_code: 'EUR',
            customs_code:  'hsCode' # Harmonized system code of your product
          }
        ]
      ).perform
```

In both cases, if the label cannot be generated it raises a StandardError with the reason. Otherwise, the parcel number is returned and files saved in the specified folders.
